Fixed by changing these parameters in ''/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ghost'':
<code>
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
ssl_ciphers "EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+SHA384 EECDH+aRSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+RC4 EECDH EDH+aRSA !RC4 !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !3DES !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS !MEDIUM";
ssl_dhparam dh4096.pem;
</code>

And ran the command: ''sudo openssl dhparam -out dh4096.pem 4096'' in the ''/etc/nginx/'' directory.
