====TCP Wrappers====

Two configuration files, referred to as TCP Wrappers, provide host access control but only for services that are ''host_access'' aware. Some services include ''inetd'' and ''sshd''.

The configuration files are in ''/etc/hosts.allow'' and ''/etc/hosts.deny''.

Format: ''service:host'' or ''service:network''

Many patterns are allowed, such as ''n.n.n.n/mm'' as well as files. See ''man hosts.allow'' for more information.

===Accept/Deny process===

  - First, ''/etc/hosts.allow'' is checked. If a match is found, network connection is accepted.
  - Second, ''/etc/hosts.deny'' is checked. If a match is found, network connection is rejected.
  - Third, upon finding no matches in either ''hosts*'' file, the network connection is accepted.

===Denying access by default===

Edit the ''/etc/hosts.deny'' file:
<code>
ALL:ALL
</code>

===Allowing host and service access===

To allow ''sendmail'', edit the ''/etc/hosts.allow'' file:
<code>
sendmail:ALL
</code>

To allow a ''/24'' network:
<code>
sshd: 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
</code>
