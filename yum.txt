Yellowdog Updater, Modified

''yum'' is dependent on repositories (libraries of packages).

''yum'' was created as a solution to the problem of "dependency hell. ''up2date'' was the precursor to ''yum''. ''yum'' was included into RHEL starting with RHEL5.

Configuration of repositories is done in ''/etc/yum.repos.d''.

Some configuration files for ''yum'':\\ 
''/etc/yum.conf''\\ 
''/etc/yum/''\\ 
''/etc/yum.repos.d''\\ 

==Run the ''man yum.conf'' command for help with configuring the repos!==
