===The /sys directory===

The ''/sys'' directory was added with the 2.6.X kernel updates. It is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem.

The directory contains kernel objects which have been ported over into userspace so that they may be both observed but also modified directly.

Devices can be found in ''/sys/block'', e.g.:
<code>
gerardo@desktop:~/Documents/stuff$ ls /sys/block/
dm-0  loop0  loop1  loop2  loop3  loop4  loop5  loop6  loop7  sda  sdb  sr0
gerardo@desktop:~/Documents/stuff$ ls /sys/block/sda/
alignment_offset  capability  device             events        events_poll_msecs  holders   power  range      ro    sda2  sda4  slaves  subsystem  uevent
bdi               dev         discard_alignment  events_async  ext_range          inflight  queue  removable  sda1  sda3  size  stat    trace
gerardo@desktop:~/Documents/stuff$ ls /sys/block/sda/sda1
alignment_offset  dev  discard_alignment  holders  inflight  partition  power  ro  size  start  stat  subsystem  trace  uevent
</code> 

The listing shows a device, ''/dev/sda'' which has four partitions. More details about the device can be gleaned from the other files in the ''/dev/sda'' directory.
