====RabbitMQ====

Starting the server: ''rabbitmq-server''\\
Checking server status: ''rabbitmqctl status''\\

Default port: 5672\\
Default user: ''guest''\\
Default password: ''guest''\\



====basic.consume====

This will place channel into a receive mode and it will consume messages until the channel is closed. This is the method to use when you want to consume many messages or for high-throughput consumption. 

====basic.get====

This places a channel into a receive mode that will stop accepting messages after ONE message is received. This method should not be used to implement functionality provided by basic.consume because basic.get in a loop is more resource intensive than basic.consume.

====vhosts====

The default vhost is ''/''.

===Managing vhosts===

==Creating a vhost==

''vhost'' creation is done using ''rabbitmqctl'':

<code>
[root@localhost ~]# rabbitmqctl add_vhost weblogs
Creating vhost "weblogs" ...
...done.
</code>

==Listing vhosts==

''vhost'' listing is done using ''rabbitmqctl'':

<code>
[root@localhost ~]# rabbitmqctl list_vhosts
Listing vhosts ...
/
weblogs
...done.
</code>

====RabbitMQ Log Files====

RabbitMQ's log files are located in ''/var/log/rabbitmq'' by default.

The ''rabbit@localhost-sasl.log'' file will contain error messages generated by Erlang. This is a useful file to check when a RabbitMQ node will not start, or if it crashes.

The other file is ''rabbit@localhost.log'' and it will contain messages related to RabbitMQ actions such as creating/removing users, connecting to exchanges, etc.

RabbitMQ has built-in log rotation functionality. Simple use ''rabbitmqctl'':

<code>
[root@localhost rabbitmq]# ls
rabbit@localhost.log  rabbit@localhost.log-20150322  rabbit@localhost-sasl.log
[root@localhost rabbitmq]# rabbitmqctl rotate_logs .$(date +%Y%m%d)
Rotating logs to files with suffix ".20150324" ...
...done.
[root@localhost rabbitmq]# ls
rabbit@localhost.log  rabbit@localhost.log-20150322  rabbit@localhost.log.20150324  rabbit@localhost-sasl.log  rabbit@localhost-sasl.log.20150324
</code>

The last argument to ''rabbitmqctl rotate_logs'' is the suffix for the old log files. Here, I used ''date'' to generate the suffix but it can also be something like a number: ''rabbitmqctl rotate_logs .1''
