======Parameters======

The Bourne shell only accepts up to 9 arguments. The variable ''$12'' would be interpreted as the variable ''$1'' followed by the number 2. For this reason, any parameters after 9 must be enclosed in braces: ''${12}''.

The variables $* and $@ will expand to all parameters, with $# containing the number of parameters that were passed to the script. 

''$0'' contains the name of the script.

===Getting Parameters Using getopts===

If the option is followed by a colon, it means that it is expecting an argument and the argument it received will be stored in ''$OPTARG''.

<code>
while getopts ab:c opt
do
    case $opt in
        a) echo "Option -a found" ;;
        b) echo "Option -b found with argument $OPTARG" ;;
        c) echo "Option -c found" ;;
        *) echo "Invalid option: $opt"; exit 5 ;;
     esac
done
</code>
