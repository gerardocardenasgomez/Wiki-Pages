====Silly Mistakes====

This is a list of silly things I have done. Hopefully they will not be done again. :)

====The Perl RegEx Fiasco====

I did something silly in this script:

<code>
user ~ $: cat test.pl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

$string = "cars.txt";
$string =~ s/\.txt/$2/;
print $string, "\n";

$test = "cars.txt";
$test =~ s/(cars)/$1oh/;
print $test, "\n";
</code>

Executing the script returns the following:

<code>
user ~ $: ./test.pl
cars
carsoh.txt
</code>

The mistake is in this line: ''$string =~ s/\.txt/$2/;''

It produces the right output because there is nothing in ''$2'' which would typically contain the value of a successful match. These come from capture groups. There is a capture group in ''$test =~ s/(cars)/$1oh/;''. The parentheses capture the string ''cars'' and it is placed into ''$1''.

The proper code should be: 

<code>
$string =~ s/\.txt//;
</code>

so that the matched string is replaced by an empty string.

====The Empty Response from HTTPD Situation====

An API call to the dev server was returning an empty response from Apache. The same call to the production server was retuning a 201 status code. Everything with the code seemed fine--nothing was being written to the Apache logs. The solution was to restart the Apache server because it encountered an issue and was not responding.
