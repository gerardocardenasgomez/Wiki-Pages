====Performance Monitoring====

===Quick Tips===
Pressing ''1'' in ''top'' will show usage information for each CPU core on its own line.

<code>
top - 09:09:41 up 15:47,  2 users,  load average: 0.59, 0.69, 0.62
Tasks: 148 total,   2 running, 146 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie

''top'': Reports process information\\
''sar'': Extensive monitoring capabilities\\
''vmstat'': Memory and swap usage\\
''iostat'': Input/Output statistics\\

====sar====

''sar'' is perfect for use with ''cron''!

Save output to /log/file, memory (-r), 10 lines 1 second each:
<code>
sar -r -o /log/file 1 10
</code>

Save CPU performance data to /log/file:
<code>
sar -o /log/file 1 10
</code>

''-d'' option for disk I/O.\\
''-n'' option for networking data, accepts additional switches:
    DEV -> networking interface information
    EDEV -> network errors
    SOCK -> Socket information
    FULL -> All three switches
    
====vmstat====

''-m'': Memory fields are shown in MB.

===Field meanings===

swpd: Used swap space\\
free: Amount of free RAM\\
buff: Amount of RAM used for buffers\\
cache: Amount of RAM used for filesystem cache\\

Swap Metrics:\\
si: Amount paged from disk to memory\\
so: Amount paged to disk from memory\\

I/O Fields:\\
bi: Blocks in from disk\\
bo: Blocks out to disk\\

===Memory States===

There are three different types of memory states: active, inactive dirty, inactive clean.

  - Active: Memory has been used recently
  - Inactive Dirty: Memory has not been used recently and may be reclaimed--in order to be reclaimed, memory must be written to disk (called "laundering").
  - Inactive Clean: Once laundered, inactive dirty memory becomes inactive clean.
