===The /dev Directory===

The ''/dev'' directory contains entries for devices, both virtual and physical.

Some interesting notes about the directory:\\ 
The files ''/dev/cdrom'' and ''/dev/dvd'' both link to ''/dev/sr0'' which is the actual device itself.\\ 
If your ''/dev'' directory contains an ''audio'' or ''dsp'' file, then you can do weird things like ''cat audio.mp3 > /dev/audio'' to play music from the command line.

''/dev/disk'' directory will contain another directory, ''by-uuid'' which can be used to determine the UUID of a device or partition.
