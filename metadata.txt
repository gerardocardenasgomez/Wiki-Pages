===Metadata===

Each cookbook contains a ''metadata.rb'' file. This file will contain information about the cookbook version, its maintainer, license, recipes, supported platforms, and more. It is a requirement!

Example ''metadata.rb'' file:
<code>
name              "postgresql"
maintainer        "Opscode, Inc."
maintainer_email  "cookbooks@opscode.com"
license           "Apache 2.0"
description       "Installs and configures PostgreSQL"
long_description  IO.read(File.join(
                    File.dirname(__FILE__), 'README.md'
                  ))
version           "3.3.4"
recipe            "postgresql", "Includes postgresql::client"
recipe            "postgresql::ruby", "Installs Ruby bindings"
recipe            "postgresql::client", 
                  "Installs client package(s)"
recipe            "postgresql::server", "Installs server packages"
recipe            "postgresql::server_redhat", 
                  "Installs RedHat server packages"
recipe            "postgresql::server_debian", 
                  "Installs Debian server packages"

%w{ubuntu debian fedora suse amazon}.each do |os|
  supports os
end

%w{redhat centos scientific oracle}.each do |el|
  supports el, ">= 6.0"
end

depends "apt"
depends "build-essential"
depends "openssl"
</code>

The file itself is a Ruby script and it therefore allows for Ruby code to be run inside of it. For example, the long_description entry is generated with Ruby code.

Additionally, the supported platform list is generated using a Ruby loop rather than writing an entry for each platform manually.

And there would be two ways of generating the list of dependencies. Line by line:
<code>
depends "apt"
depends "build-essential"
depends "openssl"
</code>

Or with a loop:
<code>
%w{apt build-essential openssl}.each do |dep|
    depends dep
end
</code>
