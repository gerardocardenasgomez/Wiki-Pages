====Advanced Package Tool (APT)====

A suite of commands that include ''apt-get'', ''apt-cache'', and ''apt-key''.

===sources.list===

The file in ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' contains a list of repositories. Running ''apt-get update'' results in the list of packages and package updates being refreshed to match the repos in ''/etc/apt/sources.list''.

===Package Searches===

''apt-cache search <keyword>'' will search the package database for packages that match they keyword. This command does not require elevated privileges. 

===Installing Packages===

''apt-get install <pkg name>'' installs the package or packages. ''apt'' now uses GPG to verify packages that it installs, although this can be skipped by using the ''--allow-unauthenticated'' option. GPG files are kept in ''/var/lib/apt/lists/'' and these files can be imported manually and packages can be checked manually against verified keys.

''SecureApt'' reference: https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt

The ''-d'' option can be used to download a package but not install it. Packages are downloaded to ''/var/cache/apt/archives/''. The downloaded package can then be transferred to another system which might not have internet access.

<code>
$ sudo apt-get -d install package
</code>

===Package Information===

The ''apt-cache show <pkg name>'' command can be used to display information about a package.

<code>

<code>

  Depends: procps
    procps:i386

    netsurf-fb
    netsurf-gtk
    uzbl

===Package Upgrades===

Updating installed packages to a newer version is done with the ''apt-get upgrade'' command. This can sometimes result in new packages being installed or packages being removed depending on the updates available. ''apt-get autoclean'' removed partially downloaded packages. Broken packages and unmet dependencies can be fixed with the ''apt-get -f install'' command.

Running ''apt-get install <pkg name>'' on a package that is installed but not up-to-date will result in ''apt'' upgrading the package.

===Version Information===

''apt-config -v'' prints ''apt'' version information.
