====Ext2====

System Extended File version 2 (Ext2) was released in 1992. Does not provide journaling. Previously the default file system on Linux.

====Ext3====

Improves on Ext2 by providing journaling and better file indexing. Uses linear indexes to track files, which makes it slower with more files.

====Ext4====

Better kernel module. Uses extents to allocate blocks. An extent is a group of blocks that can be addressed and administered as a single entity. The default size of an extent is 2MB. Ext4 is a very stable file system.

====ReiserFS====

Introduced by SUSE. Although not used often, it is a good file system for dealing with many small files. Still available in SLES12

====Btrfs====

Pronounced "butter fs" or "better fs." Developed in 2008 by Chris Mason. It is a Copy on Write (CoW) file system. Blocks that are altered are copied to new blocks, maintaining the old block as a different version.

FIXME (Include more information on CoW)

Also provides subvolumes. Lastly, snapshots are easy to create and revert to.

====XFS====

FIXME (Is XFS the default file system in SLES12?)

Uses a database to maintain its metadata. It is a versatile file system as it can be tuned for small or large files.

====UUID====

Getting the UUID of all file-systems available: ''blkid''

There is the UUID and also the Partition UUID which is created when you use GUIDs. Either can be used in ''/etc/fstab'':

<code>
UUID=
PARTUUID=
</code>

====Partitions====

Getting a list of available partitions:

<code>
ec2-user@ip-172-31-45-120:/mnt/logs> cat /proc/partitions 
major minor  #blocks  name

   3        0   10485760 hda
   3        1   10484736 hda1
 202       16   10485760 xvdb
 202       17   10484719 xvdb1
 254        0    5242880 dm-0
 254        1    5140480 dm-1
</code>

====mkfs====

Using the ''-L'' option in ''mkfs'' allows you to put a label on the new partition.

''mkfs'' is just a front-end for ''mkfs.*'' commands, such as ''mkfs.ext4''.

====fsck====

''Btrfs'' partitions generally do not need file system checks.

Useful options: -f to force a check, -y to answer yes to all questions, -c which checks bad blocks and marks them. The -b option allows for superblock backups. Usually, the 8193 block is used as the backup and so using the following command will enable a back up to the 8193 block:

<code>
fsck -b 8193 /dev/sda1
</code>
