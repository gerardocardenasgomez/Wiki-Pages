====The Zen of Python====

  * Beautiful is better than ugly
  * Explicit is better than implicit
  * Simple is better than complex
  * Complex is better than complicated
    * Complex: Made up of many interconnected parts
	* Complicated: So complex as to be difficult to understand
  * Flat is better than nested
  * Readability counts
  * Special rules aren't special enough to break the rules
  * Practicality beats purity
  * Errors should never pass silently
  * There should be one obvious way to do it
  * If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
  * Don't repeat yourself
  * 

====Quick Examples====

===Opening files in binary mode for Python 2.7 and Python 3====

<code>
with open('/tmp/random.bin', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(os.urandom(10))
</code>

===Using boolean expressions in place of if statements===

<code>
>>> cars = []
>>> num_of_cars = cars or 0
>>> num_of_cars
0
</code>

===Enumerator vs range===

<code>
for i in range(len(flavor_list)):
    flavor = flavor_list[i]
    print('%d: %s' % (i + 1, flavor))
    
for i, flavor in enumerate(flavor_list):
    print('%d: %s' % (i + 1, flavor))
    
for i, flavor in enumerate(flavor_list, 1):
    print('%d: %s' % (i, flavor))
</code>

===Testing for numbers===

<code>
try:
    val = int(num)
except:
    print("That ain't no number I ever heard of")
</code>
