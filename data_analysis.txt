====Data Analysis Basics====

Four things to have:

  - The raw data itself
    - Ran no software on data
    - No manipulation of the data
    - No data was removed
    - No data was summarized in any way
  - A tidy data set 
    - Each variable should be in one column
    - Each different observation should be in a different row
    - One table for each "kind" of variable
    - Multiple tables should be linked
    - Variable names should be human readable
  - A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set
    - Information about the variables (including units)
    - Information about the summary choices you made
    - Information about the experimental study design you used
    - Use a common format (e.g. plain text file)
    - Describe how the data was collected
  - An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 > 2 > 3
    - Ideally a computer script (R, Python, etc.)
    - Input for the script should be raw data
    - Output is the processed, tidy data
    - No parameters to the script!
    - If more steps are necessary, provide additional instructions
