A large, but disjointed, hash structure.

Set of priorities:\\ 
Default\\ 
Normal\\ 
Override\\ 

The order in which data is obtained:\\ 
Cookbook attribute files -> environment -> role -> node config data stored on the Chef server

Attribute files are loaded in alphabetical order.

Multiple Platform Support:\\ 
<code>
default[:users]['root'][:group] = value_for_platform(
  "openbsd"   => { "default" => "wheel" },
  "freebsd"   => { "default" => "wheel" },
  "ubuntu"    => { "default" => "admin" },
  "default"   => "root"
)
</code>

==include_attribute==
''include_attribute'' is used to load external attributes. Before using them, make sure to place the other cookbooks as a dependency.

<code>
include_attribute "apache"
default['mywebapp']['port'] = node['apache']['port']
</code>

That will load attributes from the ''default.rb'' file. For other files, specify them as such:
<code>
include_attribute "postgresql::client"
</code>

That code would load attributes from the client.rb file in the postgresql cookbook.

==Getting A Node's Attributes==
''$ knife node show -l nodename''

Any attribute can then be used:
''<%= node["languages"]["python"]["version"] %>''
