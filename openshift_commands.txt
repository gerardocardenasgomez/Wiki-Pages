====OpenShift====

<code>
rhc app create gcscripts python-2.7
rhc show-app gcscripts
</code>

====Sample Code====

When passing a parameter, it must be named appropriately! Otherwise there will be a server error.
<code>
@app.route("/status/<site>")
def check_page(site):
    return webstatus.check_page(site)
</code>

====OpenShift Environment Variables====

OpenShift supplies environment variables for the applications and cartridges. It is possible to access the environment variables using Python with the ''os'' package:

<code>
import os

mongo_host = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST']
mongo_port = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT']

mongo_user = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_USERNAME']
mongo_pass = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD']
</code>

It's also possible to set custom environment variables:

<code>
$ rhc env set <Variable>=<Value> <Variable2>=<Value2> -a App_Name
</code>

Note that when it comes to security, environment variables are better than storing information in plaintext. However, although it is suggested to use environment variables for production, this method is nevertheless inherently insecure and caution must be exercised when using them. It is possible, both in Linux and Windows, to view the environment variables that a process is using regardless of the user and process owner.
