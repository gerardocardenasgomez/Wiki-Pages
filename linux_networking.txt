===tcp_tw_reuse===

The tcp_tw_reuse tunable allows a TIME-WAIT session to be reused when it appears safe to do so. This can allow higher rates of connections between two hosts, such as between a web server and a database, without hitting the 16-bit ephemeral port limit with sessions in TIME-WAIT.

tcp_tw_recycle is another way to reuse TIME-WAIT sessions, although not as safe as tcp_tw_reuse.
