====Linux Networking====

====tcpdump====

Let's use ''tcpdump'' to solve some issues!

Getting data from an interface:

<code>
tcpdump -n -i eth1:1
</code>

The ''-n'' flag is going to stop ''tcpdump'' from using DNS to resolve IP addresses. The ''-i'' flag allows the interface to be specified in the command line.

It's possible to specify more than one criteria using logical operators like ''and'' and ''or'':

<code>
tcpdump -i eth1:1 port 80 and src 10.0.0.1
</code>

===Reading tcpdump files===

You can use ''tcpdump'' itself to view a dump:

<code>
tcpdump -qns 0 -X -r bond-net-data.dump
</code>

Or you can use ''tshark'':

<code>
tshark -r net-data.dump -V | less
</code>

====Tunable Kernel Parameters====

===tcp_tw_reuse===

The tcp_tw_reuse tunable allows a TIME-WAIT session to be reused when it appears safe to do so. This can allow higher rates of connections between two hosts, such as between a web server and a database, without hitting the 16-bit ephemeral port limit with sessions in TIME-WAIT.

tcp_tw_recycle is another way to reuse TIME-WAIT sessions, although not as safe as tcp_tw_reuse.
